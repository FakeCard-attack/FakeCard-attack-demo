# FakeCard-attack-demo

We uploaded two videos of the FakeCard attack pattern:

Tag Data Forgery: the affected app is WeCom, the attacker sends the malicious link to the app and generates the fake card.

Preview Data Hijacking: the affected apps are Taobao and Alipay, the attacker manipulate the shared content from Taobao to Alipay, and generated the fake card.

The two attack patterns can both use to sniff the victim's IP address by the attacker.
